# project3

Project template with:

* typescript + swc
* eslint for linting
* mocha + chai for testing
* nyc/istanbul for testing coverage
* github node.js ci action

Replace all occurrences of "project3" with actual project name.

```
cd packages/package1
npm ci
```

Notes

* slightly older versions of mocha/ts-node/typescript for making mocha work with swc and be actually fast
